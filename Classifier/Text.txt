Characteristics of Living Organisms  Movement: action by an organism or part of an organism causing a change of position or place  Respiration: the chemical reactions that break down nutrient molecules in living cells to release energy  Sensitivity: ability to detect or sense changes in the environment (stimuli) and to make responses  Growth: permanent increase in size and dry mass by an increase in cell number or cell size or both  Reproduction: processes that make more of the same kind of organism  Excretion: removal from organisms of toxic materials, the waste products of metabolism (chemical reactions in cells including respiration) and substances in excess of requirements  Nutrition: taking in of nutrients which are organic substances and mineral ions, containing raw materials or energy for growth and tissue repair, absorbing and assimilating them

 Organisms can be classified into groups by the features that they share  Classification systems aim to reflect evolutionary relationships (change of adaptive features of a population over time, as a result of natural selection)  Species: organisms which can reproduce successfully  Classification is traditionally based on studies of morphology and anatomy  Morphology: the overall form and shape of their bodies e.g. wings or legs  Anatomy: the detailed body structure determined by dissection  Binomial system: a system of naming species in which the scientific name of an organism is made up of two parts showing the genus (starting with a capitol letter) and species (starting with a lower case letter), written in italics when printed (therefore underlined when written) e.g. Homo sapiens 
 
KING PHILIP CAME OVER FOR GOOD SPAGHETTI  Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species  Kingdom  Species = Similarity increases 
 DNA is the chemical from which chromosomes are made  Each DNA molecule is made up of strings of smaller molecules containing four bases  Biologists compare the sequences of the bases in the DNA of organisms from two different species  The more similar the base sequence, the more closely related the species are to one another  Organisms which share a more recent ancestor have base sequences in DNA that are more similar than those that share only a distant ancestor  The sequences of bases in DNA and of amino acids in proteins are used as a more accurate means of classification (cladistics)
