Concept & Use of a Classification System  Organisms can be classified into groups by the features that they share  Classification systems aim to reflect evolutionary relationships (change of adaptive features of a population over time, as a result of natural selection)  Species: organisms which can reproduce successfully  Classification is traditionally based on studies of morphology and anatomy  Morphology: the overall form and shape of their bodies e.g. wings or legs  Anatomy: the detailed body structure determined by dissection  Binomial system: a system of naming species in which the scientific name of an organism is made up of two parts showing the genus (starting with a capitol letter) and species (starting with a lower case letter), written in italics when printed (therefore underlined when written) e.g. Homo sapiens 
 
KING PHILIP CAME OVER FOR GOOD SPAGHETTI  Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species  Kingdom  Species = Similarity increases 
 DNA is the chemical from which chromosomes are made  Each DNA molecule is made up of strings of smaller molecules containing four bases  Biologists compare the sequences of the bases in the DNA of organisms from two different species  The more similar the base sequence, the more closely related the species are to one another  Organisms which share a more recent ancestor have base sequences in DNA that are more similar than those that share only a distant ancestor  The sequences of bases in DNA and of amino acids in proteins are used as a more accurate means of classification (cladistics)

Diffusion  This is the movement of molecules from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration down the concentration gradient.   This results in random movement of molecules until equilibrium is reached  The diffusion of gases and solutes is important as without it, molecules which are needed for life, for example glucose and oxygen for respiration, would not be able to get to the places they are needed. Water is needed as a solvent  Factors influencing faster diffusion: o Larger concentration gradient o Higher temperature o Smaller surface area 
{#
[3.2]
Osmosis  Movement of water molecules from a region of high water potential to a region of low water potential, through a partially permeable membrane  Conc. of solute outside cell = conc. inside cell → no change in size  Conc. of solute outside cell > conc. inside cell → cell shrinks (Plasmolysis)  Conc. of solute outside cell < conc. inside cell → cell swells (Turgid)  In animals: o Increasing solute concentration inside of cell can cause cell to explode as a result of it having too much water, crenation. 
 CIE IGCSE BIOLOGY//0610  
 
PAGE 6 OF 35 
 In plants: o Increasing solute concentration inside of cell causes cell to become turgid, vacuole fills up. o Decreasing solute concentration inside of cell causes cell to become flaccid, losing water and vacuole gets smaller. Cell body shrinks, pulling away from cell wall 
{#
[3.3]
Active Transport  Movement of particles through a cell membrane, from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration against a concentration gradient, using energy released during respiration  Active transport is needed when an organism wants to optimize the amount of nutrients it can take up - ion uptake by root hairs and uptake of glucose by epithelial cells of villi.

Structure of a DNA  Chromosomes are made of a molecule called DNA  Each chromosome is a very long molecule of tightly coiled DNA 
 Two strands coiled together to form a double helix  Each strand contains chemicals called bases  Cross-links between strands are formed by pairs of bases  The bases always pair up in the same way:  o A and T o C and G 

{#
[5.1]
Effect of Temperature on Enzymes  Enzymes have an optimum temperature: the temperature at which they work best giving the fastest reaction ≈ 37°C in animals  When temperature increases, molecules move faster so collide with an enzyme in less time  Having more energy makes them more likely to bind to active site.  If temperature is too high, enzyme molecules vibrate too vigorously and enzyme is denatured; it loses its shape and will no longer bind with a substrate.   When the temperature is too low there is not enough kinetic energy for the reaction so it reacts too slowly. 
{#
[5.2]
Effect of pH on Enzymes  Enzymes are sensitive to pH  Some enzymes work best in an acid and others in an alkaline   Enzymes work best at their optimum pH  If the pH is changed then the enzyme will denature and will no longer fit with substrate- no reaction takes place

Enzymes and their Uses  Seeds to germinate: the enzymes turn insoluble food stores to soluble.  Biological washing powders: enzymes are added to washing powders to help remove stains for example: o Lipase for lipids from fatty foods and greasy fingerprints o Protease for proteins from blood stains  Food industry: o Isomerase converts glucose to fructose which is sweeter, so less is needed to give a sweet taste o Pectinase helps break down cell walls in fruit juice production so it increases yield, lowers viscosity and reduces cloudiness

Chlorophyll Is Necessary for Photosynthesis  Take a potted plant with variegated (green and white) leaves.  Destarch the plant by keeping it in complete darkness for about 48 hours.  Expose the plant to the sunlight for a few days.  Leaf boiled in water for 2 minutes to break down cell walls, denature enzymes and allow for easier penetration by ethanol. 
 Warmed in ethanol until leaf is colourless to extract chlorophyll, which would mask observation   Dipped in water briefly: to soften leaf  Leaf is placed on a white tile and iodine is added. If starch is present, colour will be blue-black and if absent, it will remain orange 
 
{#

Limiting Factors •Limiting factor: something present in the environment in such short supply that it restricts life processes. 
Light intensity  As the amount of light increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases (a-b)  The limiting factor is light   Increasing the amount of light after a certain point has no effect on the rate (c)  The limiting factor is now carbon dioxide or temperature  
 Carbon dioxide concentration  As the amount of carbon dioxide increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases (a-b)  The limiting factor is carbon dioxide   Increasing amount of carbon dioxide after a certain point has not effect on rate (c)   The limiting factor is now light or temperature (warmth) 
 Temperature  As temperature increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases until it reaches optimum temperature 40°c (a)  The limiting factor is the temperature   Increasing the temperature above 40°c will cause the enzymes to denature (b)   This will decrease rate of photosynthesis  
 {#
 [6.5]
 Glasshouse Systems To increase the crop yield, farmers control the limiting factors:  CO2 enrichment: paraffin is burnt to increase CO2 concentration by three times the original amount and doubling the yield  Optimum temperature: thermostatically controlled heaters make the temperature right for enzymes to work  Optimum light: light has a high intensity for more photosynthesis, the correct wavelengths (red and blue not green) and duration controls production of fruit

Leaf Structure 
 Cuticle: waxy layer that prevents water loss from top of the leaf   Epidermis: transparent cell that allows sunlight to pass through to the palisade cell  Palisade: found at the top of the cell and contains many chloroplasts which absorbs sunlight.  Spongy mesophyll layer: irregularly shaped cells which create air spaces to allow gaseous exchange to take place; do not contain many chloroplasts   Vascular Bundle: made up of xylem and phloem  Xylem: vessel which transports water and dissolved minerals and has lignified walls made of cellulose   Phloem: vessel which transports nutrients   Stomata: little holes that opens and closes to allow gaseous exchange to take place. The stomata close to prevent water loss and open to let gases come in and out. When guard cells lose water, the stoma close (at night), while the stoma open when guard cells gain water & swell (during the day).

Phloem  Bidirectional vessel  Contains sieve elements which allow sugars to pass from one cell to next downwards   Contains companion cells which provide energy for active transport of sugars all over plant.   Translocation moves organic molecules (sugars, amino acids) from source to sink.   Phloem vessels still have cross walls called sieve plates that contain pores.   Companion cells actively load sucrose into the phloem.  Water follows high solute in phloem by osmosis. A positive pressure potential develops moving mass of phloem sap forward.  Phloem still contains small amount of cytoplasm along the walls but the organelle content is greatly reduced.  Companion cells actively unload (ATP used) the organic molecules {#

Mineral Requirements NITROGEN MAGNESIUM  Needed for protein synthesis  Deficiency: small plant, slow growth, top leaves pale, bottom leaves dead and roots slightly affected  Needed for chlorophyll synthesis  Deficiency: plant lack chlorphyll, leaves yellow but normal roots  Nitrogen fertilizers: provide nitrogen in the form of nitrate ions, nitrite ions or ammonium ions. But using fertilisers can lead to eutrophication, which is when the fertiliser is transported by rain and leaches into stagnant water e.g. pond or river

Malnutrition  A condition caused by eating an unbalanced diet. Several forms: o Overnutrition: balanced diet but eating too much of everything o Undernutrition: having too little food o Eating foods in incorrect proportions  {#
[7.2]
Effects of Malnutrition  Starvation: losing strength & finally dying because of lack of food  Coronary heart disease: eating too much fats which are rich in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, may lead to heart attack  Constipation: lack of roughages in food causes constipation because roughages are indigestible and form bulks. Friction between bulks and walls of intestine stimulate the peristalsis  Obesity: Eating too much fats and carbohydrates leads to their storage in storage in the body mainly in the forms of fats and causing an increase in body weight. This can cause; heart attack, stroke, joint pain, mobility impairment, high blood pressure {#

Human Alimentary Canal  Ingestion: taking substances (e.g. food, drink) into the body through the mouth.  Egestion: passing out of food that has not been digested, as faeces, through the anus.  Digestion: the break-down of large, insoluble food molecules into small, water soluble molecules using mechanical and chemical processes  Mouth: contains teeth used for mechanical digestion, area where food is mixed with salivary amylase & where ingestion takes place  Salivary glands: produce saliva which contains amylase and helps food slide down oesophagus  Oesophagus: tubeshaped organ which uses peristalsis to transport food from mouth to stomach  Stomach: has sphincters to control movement into and also has pepsin (a protease) to break down proteins into peptides, it also kills bacteria with hydrochloric acid. They also have elastic walls.  Small intestine: tube shaped organ composed of two parts the:  o Duodenum: fats are emulsified by bile, and digested by pancreatic lipase to form fatty acids and glycerol. Pancreatic amylase and trypsin (a protease) break down starch and peptides into maltose and amino acids o Ileum: Maltase breaks down maltose to glucose. This is where absorption takes place; adapted by having villi and microvilli.  Pancreas: produces pancreatic juice which contains amylase, trypsin and lipase and hydrogencarbonate.  Liver: produces bile, stores glucose as glycogen, interconverting them to keep glucose concentration constant. Also carries out interconversion of amino acids (transamination), deamination and removal of old red blood cells and storage of their iron. Also site of breakdown of alcohol and other toxins.  Gall bladder: stores bile from liver  Bile: produced by liver and stored in gall bladder, its role is to emulsify fats, to increase surface area for the action of enzymes. 
 Large intestine: tube shaped organ composed of two parts: o Colon: organ for absorption of minerals and vitamins, and reabsorbing water from waste to maintain body’s water levels o Rectum: where faeces are temporarily stored  Anus: ring of muscle which controls when faeces is released. {#
[7.6]
Diarrhoea  Diarrhoea: when not enough water is absorbed from the faeces   To cure this is to give oral rehydration therapy  One of these this infectious by a bacterium causing the diseases cholera (spreads rapidly)  The cholera bacterium produces a toxin that causes secretion of chloride ions into the small intestine, causing osmotic movement of water into the gut, causing diarrhoea, dehydration and loss of salts from the blood

 Chemical Digestion  Where enzymes are used to break down large insoluble substances such as proteins into smaller soluble substances like amino acids so that they can be absorbed.  Amylase: breaks down starch into maltose, it is produced in the pancreas (but also in the salivary gland)  Protease: breaks down proteins to peptides (done by pepsin) then into amino acids (done by trypsin). Pepsin comes from the stomach and trypsin comes from the pancreas.  Lipase: breaks down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol, produced by the pancreas.  Hydrochloric acid in gastric juice: o Denaturing enzymes in harmful microorganisms in food o Giving the optimum pH for pepsin activity {#
[7.12]
 Absorption  Movement of digested food molecules through wall of the intestine into the blood or lymph.  The small intestine is the region for absorption of digested food.  The small intestine is folded into many villi which increase the surface area for absorption. One villus will have tiny folds on the cells on its outside called microvilli.   More surface area means more absorption can happen  Capillary: transports glucose and amino acids 
 Vein: delivers absorbed products to liver via hepatic portal vein.  Gland: produces enzymes  Lacteal: absorbs fatty acid and glycerol  Epithelium: only one cell thick for faster transport. The cells of the epithelium are folded to form microvilli.   Small intestine and colon absorb water  o The small intestine absorbs 5–10 dm3 per day  o The colon absorbs 0.3–0.5 dm3 per day

[8.3]
Pathway Taken By Water  Water enters root hair cell from moist soil via osmosis because water potential is higher in soil than in cytoplasm.  Water passes through the cortex cells by osmosis but mostly by “suction”.  Water and minerals are forced to cross the endodermis.  Water enters xylem then leaves when it gets to mesophyll cells {#
[8.4]
Transpiration  Transpiration: evaporation of water at surfaces of the mesophyll cells followed by loss of water vapour from plant leaves, through stomata.  Water leaves mesophyll cells, into air spaces created by irregular shape of spongy mesophyll cells, then diffuses out of the stomata.  Wilting: occurs if water loss is greater than water uptake – cells become flaccid, tissues become limp and plant no longer supported {#
[8.5]
Uptake of Water  Caused by water loss in leaves which lowers its water potential   Water moves from xylem to leaf tissues via osmosis  Water moves up the stem in the xylem due to tension (because of cohesion of water molecules to each other) caused by water loss from the leaves   Ends with the gain of water through roots  This upward flow of water is called the transpiration stream {#
[8.6]
Factors Affecting Rate of Transpiration  Temperature: higher temperatures increase waterholding capacity of air and increases transpiration rate  Humidity: low humidity increases water potential gradient between leaf and atmosphere  increasing transpiration rate  Light intensity: high light intensity causes stomata to open (to allow more photosynthesis) which causes increase in transpiration 
{#
[8.7]
Translocation  Movement of sucrose and amino acids in phloem; from regions of production (sources) to regions of storage or to regions of utilization in respiration or growth (sinks).  Translocation in different seasons: o Spring: sucrose transported from stores in roots to leaves o Summer & early autumn: sucrose goes from photosynthesizing leaves to root stores,

Cardiac Cycle 
   Cardiac diastole: all chambers are relaxed, and blood flows into the heart Atrial systole, ventricular diastole: atria contract, pushing blood into the ventricles Atrial diastole, ventricular systole: after atria relax, ventricles contract, pushing blood out of heart  Physical activity makes the heart beat more quickly and more deeply, for an increased circulation of blood so that more oxygen and glucose can get to the muscles.
