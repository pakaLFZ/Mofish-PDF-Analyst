Kinetic Particle Theory 
 
 
 When a solid is heated, particles vibrate faster about a fixed point causing particles to move further apart and so solid expands  When particles gain sufficient energy to overcome strong forces of attraction, they move out of their fixed position and can slide over each other in a continuous random motion – solid has melted.  Particles in liquid have energy to move around but are still close to each other and do not have enough energy to overcome the forces that hold them close to each other.  If more heat’s supplied, particles move faster until they have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction. Particles escape the liquids surface and move around in continuous rapid motion – the liquid has boiled  In the vapor, the particles move in rapid random motion. This movement is due to collision of vapor particles with air particles.

 States of Matter SOLID LIQUID GAS  Strong forces of attraction between particles  Fixed pattern (lattice)   Atoms vibrate but can’t change position ∴ fixed volume and shape  Weaker attractive forces than solids  No fixed pattern, liquids take up the shape of their container  Particles slide past each other.  Almost no intermolecular forces  Particles far apart, and move quickly  Collide with each other and bounce in all directions

 Diffusion  Diffusion is the spreading of one substance through another from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration due to the continuous random motion of particles.  Evidence for diffusion:  In liquids: potassium manganate (VII) in a beaker of water  In gases: a gas jar of air and a gas jar of bromine connected   Factors that affect the rate of diffusion:  Temperature increases → rate of diffusion increases  Lower density gas → rate of diffusion is higher

Critertia of Purity  Paper chromatography:  o Drop substance to center of filter paper and allow it to dry o Drop water on substance, one drop at a time o Paper + rings = chromatogram.  o Principle: Difference in solubility separates different pigments o Substances travel across paper at different rates which is why they separate into rings o Method works because different substances travel at different levels of attraction to it 
 
 Stationary phase is material on which separation takes place   Mobile phase consists of the mixture you want to separate, dissolved in a solvent. 
 
 Interpreting simple chromatograms: o Number of rings/dots = number of substances o If two dots travel the same distance up the paper they are the same substance. o You can calculate the Rf value to identify a substance, given by the formula: 
𝑅𝑓 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = 
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑒 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡
   To make colourless substances visible, use a locating agent:  o Dry paper in oven  o Spray it with locating agent o Heat it for 10 minutes in oven  Assesing purity from m.p./b.p: o Pure substances have a definite, sharp m.p./b.p. o Substance+impurity has lower m.p. and higher b.p. o More impurity means bigger change

Simple Distillation  Impure liquid is heated  It boils, and steam rises into the condenser  Impurities are left behind 
Condenser is cold so steam condenses to the pure liquid and it drops into the beaker 
 

#>
<#
[2.6]
Fractional Distillation  Removes a liquid from a mixture of liquids, because liquids have different b.p.s   Mixture is heated to evaporate substance with lowest b.p.  some of the other liquid(s) will evaporate too.   A mixture of gases condense on the beads in the fractional column.   So the beads are heated to the boiling point of the lowest substance, so that substance being removed cannot condense on the beads.   The other substances continue to condense and will drip back into the flask.  
The beaker can be changed after every fraction

MASS (ATOMIC MASS ) Proton +1 1 Neutron 0 1 Electron -1 1 1837 ⁄  Proton number: number of protons in an atom (and number of electrons in an atom)  Nucleon number:  number of protons + neutrons in an atom.  In the periodic table o The proton number increases by 1 when you go to the right o When you go one element down, you increase proton number by 8 in the first 3 periods (transition elements not included)  Isotopes: atoms of same element with different no. of neutrons  o E.g. Carbon 12 and Carbon 1

 Two types: non-radioactive isotopes and radioactiveisotopes which are unstable atoms that break down giving radiations o Medical use: cancer treatment (radiotherapy) – rays kill cancer cells using cobalt-60 o Industrial use: to check for leaks – radioisotopes (tracers) added to oil/gas. At leaks radiation is detected using a Geiger counter.

 Electrons are arranged in electron shells.   Atoms want to have full outer shells (full set of valency electrons), this is why they react.  Noble gases have full outer shells so they have no need to react.   Electron shell structure: 2, 8, 8, 18

 More reactive elements have a greater desire to have a full outer shell, so also form more stable compounds.

Extraction of Aluminium  The main ore of aluminium is bauxite – high m.p.  Aluminium (III) oxide (alumina) is dissolved in molten cryolite (Na3AlF6) – this mixture has a lower m.p. (industrially preferred) 
 
 During electrolysis aluminium is produced at the carbon cathode and oxygen at the carbon anode.  Due to the high temp. the oxygen reacts with the graphite anode to form CO2 and so anode had to be periodically replaced

Production of Energy  A fuel is a substance which can be conveniently used as a source of energy.   Burning fuels (like oil) to form oxides is an exothermic reaction.   The heat from burning fuels is used in power plants to create steam from water and turn turbines. 
 CIE IGCSE CHEMISTRY//9093  
 
PAGE 10 OF 22 
 In order for any material to combust three things must be present: o Fuel o Heat o Oxygen  A good fuel would: o Be cheap o Be available in large quantities o Ba a liquid at room temperature o Produce a large amount of energy when combusted o Not produce polluting gases

[6.5]
Hydrogen  Burns explosively with oxygen, so it is used in rockets.   In a fuel cell, it combines with oxygen without burning.  Produced by reacting methane gas with steam 
ADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES  Produces a lot of energy  Abundant on earth (sea)  Less pollutant  Renewable fuel  Difficult to transport as it is a gas at room temperature  Forms explosive mixture with air – very dangerous

[6.6]
Simple Cells  A cell is a device which converts chemical energy into electrical energy and is composed of two metals of different reactivity connected by an external circuit and an electrolyte  The process works due to the different reactivity of metals  Consists of a negative pole (the more reactive metal) and a positive pole (less reactive metal) and an electrolyte.   The greater the difference in reactivity of the two metals, the greater the voltage will be.   The electrons flow because one metal is more reactive, so it has a stronger drive to give up its electrons.   The atoms give up electrons and enter the solution as ions.

Collision Theorey  Collisions are needed for a chemical reaction to take place  Successful collisions have enough activation energy at moment of impact to break preexisting bonds and form new bonds 

#>
<#
[7.2]
Rates of Reaction  Rate of a chemical reaction is the concentration of reactant used up or product made in a given time.  Unit = (mol/dm3)/s 

#>
<#
[7.3]
Concentration  Increasing concentration of reactants increases rate of reaction  This is because there are more particles per unit volume, so the collision rate between reacting particles increases, therefore the successful collision rate increases, which results in an increased rate of reaction. 
 


#>
<#
[7.4]
Temperature  Increasing temperature increases the rate of reaction  This is because average kinetic energy of particles increase which means they are moving faster & also more particles have an energy greater/equal to activation energy, therefore successful collision rate increases, resulting in increased rate of reaction 
 CIE IGCSE CHEMISTRY//9093  
 
PAGE 11 OF 22 
 


#>
<#
[7.5]
Particle Size  Decreasing the particle size (increasing surface area) increases the rate of reaction  This is because there are more reactant particles exposed to collide, so the collision rate increases, therefore the successful collision rate increases, resulting in an increased rate of reaction 
 
 Large surface area can mean danger. For example, flour dust and wood dust have large surface areas, and are combustible. A spark from a machine, or a lit match, can cause an explosion. This also applies to gases from mines. 

#>
<#
[7.6]
Pressure in Gaseous System  Increasing the pressure in a gaseous system increases the rate of reaction  The distance between particles is reduced under pressure  There are more particles per unit volume, so the collision rate increases, therefore the successful collision rate increases, resulting in an increased rate of reaction. 

#>
<#
[7.7]
Catalyst  A catalyst is a substance (usually a transition metal) which speeds up a chemical reaction, but remains unchanged at the end  Adding a catalyst increases the rate of reaction  A catalyst allows the reaction to go by an alternative pathway with lower activation energy  More particles will have an energy greater than or equal to the activation energy, therefore successful collision rate increases resulting in increased rate of reaction 
 For gaseous reactants, if catalyst is solid metal, the catalyst provides a surface for reaction to take place on  The larger the surface are of the metal catalyst, the larger the area for reaction to take place therefore higher rate of reaction 
 
 Enzymes are protein molecules. They are biological catalysts which speed up reactions but remain chemically unchanged at the end  Enzymes function best at optimum temperature and pH level otherwise they may denature and completely stop functioning

If a gas evolves, measure volume of gas produced per unit time using a gas syringe 
If a gas evolves, measure loss in mass per unit time by placing on a balance then putting a cotton wool on top to allow gas to pass but not to enter

Light Causing a Chemical Reaction  A photochemical reaction is one where light causes a reaction to occur. The higher the light intensity the higher the rate of the reaction.  Photosynthesis: light provides energy for the reaction and chlorophyll is a dye that absorbs light. carbon dioxide + water → (light + chlorophyll) → glucose + oxygen 6CO2 + 6H2O → (light + chlorophyll) → C6H12O6 + 6O2

 Reversible Reactions  A reversible reaction is a reaction in which reactants form products and the product(s) can then react or decompose to form the reactants  Example: CuSO
 #>
 <#
 [4.5]
 2O (blue) ⇌ CuSO4(white) + H2O  (to get anhydrous, heat it, & to get hydrated form, add water)  There are two types of equilibrium: static and dynamic.  At dynamic equilibrium: o Rate of forward reaction = rate of reverse reaction o Concentrations of all reactants and products remain constant o System is closed, and on large scale everything is constant 
 
 #>
 <#
[7.11]
 Equilibrium  Le Châtelier’s Principle: if conditions of an equilibrium are changed, the position of equilibrium moves to oppose change  Temperature: Temperature lowered; equilibrium moves in exothermic direction. Temperature raised; equilibrium moves in endothermic direction.  Pressure: Pressure raised; equilibrium moves to side with fewest gas molecules. Pressure lowered; equilibrium moves to side with most gas molecules.  Concentration: Decreasing reactant concentration or increasing product concentration; equilibrium moves to reactant side. Increasing reactant concentration or decreasing product concentration; equilibrium moves to product side.

 Redox  A redox reaction is one in which one species has been oxidized and another species has been reduced OXIDATION MEANS: REDUCTION MEANS:  Loss of electrons  Gain of oxygen  Loss of hydrogen  Gain of electrons  Loss of oxygen  Gain of hydrogen OIL RIG  Reducing agents are oxidized and oxidizing agents are reduced  Potassium iodide is a reducing agent & will go from colorless to red-brown, so is oxidized to produce I2 H2O2 + 2KI + H2SO4→I2 + K2SO4 + 2H2O 
 Potassium manganate is an oxidising agent and will go from purple to colourless  To test for an oxidising agent, add a reducing agent (KI) and to test for a reducing agent, add an oxidising agent (KMnO4)

HE PERIODIC TABLE  The Periodic table is a method of classifying elements.   They are arranged in order of increasing atomic number.   Made up of rows called periods and columns called groups  Metals are to the left and non-metals are to the right.   Elements in the same group have similar properties.   Group number tells us the number of valency electrons and the period number tells us about the number of electron shells 


Periodic Trends  Non-metals are on the right side of the periodic table, and metals are on the left.   Down a period of metals they become more reactive  With non-metals, going down a period, the non-metal becomes less reactive

Alloys  An alloy is two or more metals, or a metal and non-metal which have been made molten and then mixed together  Alloys are used because they have improved qualities for a particular job over the pure metals 
ALLOY MADE FROM SPECIAL PROPERTIES 
USES 
Brass Copper and zinc 
Stronger and more resistant to corrosion 
Electrical fittings, car radiators 
Bronze Copper and tin 
Harder, stronger and sonorous 
Statues, springs, coins 
Stainless steel 
Iron, chromium  and nickel

[10.4]
Displacement Reactions  These are reactions in which metals compete for oxygen or anions  The more reactive metal will displace the less reactive metal from oxygen or an anion.  If more reactive metal has oxygen or an anion, no reaction occurs  The bigger the difference in reactivity between the two metals, the faster the reaction

11,6 Fractional Distillation of Air  Air is filtered to remove dust  Water vapor and carbon dioxide removed, (because they would freeze and block the pipes): o air is cooled until water vapor condenses o then passes over absorbent beads to trap carbon dioxide 
 It is compressed, causing it to heat up. Cooled by recycling cold air   The cold compressed air is passed through a jet, into a larger space. It expands rapidly, making it very cold.  This is repeated, cooling the air more. By -200°C it is liquid except for neon and helium. These gases are removed. They can be separated from each other by absorption on charcoal.  The liquid air is pumped into the fractioning column. There it is slowly warmed up. The gases boil off one by one, and are collected in tanks or cylinders.  Sources of methane: oil and natural gas, decomposition of vegetation, and waste gases from digestion in animals #>

   Each carbon atoms in an alkene has four covalent single bonds – this makes them quite unreactive. 
Combustion:  Complete combustion: enough oxygen supply so water and carbon dioxide form.  e.g. CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O  Incomplete: is not enough oxygen to burn them cleanly so either carbon monoxide and water or carbon and water form. e.g. 2CH4 + 3O2 → 2CO + 4H2O                      or e.g. CH4 + O2 → C + 2H2O 
Chlorine substitution:   Sunlight or light is necessary   A chlorine atom replaces a hydrogen atom  This can happen to all hydrogen atoms if there is enough chlorine. e.g. CH4 + Cl2 → (light) → HCl + CH3Cl / CH2Cl2 / CHCl3 / CCl4 Compounds = chloromethane / di/tri/tetrachloromethane

 In digestion proteins are broken down into amino acids (hydrolysis). Fats:  Fats are esters possessing the same linkage as Terylene (ester links) but with different units.  Soap is a product of the hydrolysis of fat. It is done using sodium hydroxide (as opposed to acid, in digestion). The hydrolysis gives glycerol and the sodium salts of fatty acids. The salts are used as soaps. Carbohydrates:  Complex carbohydrates: are a large number of joined sugar units (monosaccharide like glucose). The sugar units are represented like this: 
 
They join together in a condensation polymerization 
 
 In digestion, the hydrolysis (Decomposition of a chemical compound by reaction with water) of starch happens in the mouth by the enzyme amylase to make glucose  Hydrolysis: o Starch → glucose o Proteins → amino acids o Fats → fatty acids and glycerol  But if hydrolysis is not complete, macromolecules are not completely broken down so you get a mixture of molecules of different sizes  Identification: o Chromatography can be used to identify products & substances o However, amino acids and sugars are colourless when dissolved in water, so a locating agent is used.  o Substances can be identified using Rf values or by matching them with spots which are horizontal
