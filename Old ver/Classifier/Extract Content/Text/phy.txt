ength and Time LENGTH • A rule (ruler) is used to measure length for distances between 1mm and 1meter. • For even smaller lengths, use a micrometer screw gauge. • SI unit for length is the meter (m) • To find out volume of regular object, use mathematical formula • To find out volume of irregular object, put object into measuring cylinder with water. When object added, it displaces water, making water level rise. Measure this rise. This is the volume. TIME • Interval of time is measured using clocks or a stopwatch • SI unit for time is the second(s) • To find the amount of time it takes a pendulum to make a spin, time ~25 circles and then divide by the same number as the number of circles.

orces • Force is measured in Newtons 𝑭𝒐𝒓𝒄𝒆 = 𝑴𝒂𝒔𝒔 × 𝑨𝒄𝒄𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 • 1 Newton is the amount of force needed to give 1kg an acceleration of 1m/s2 • A force may produce a change in size and shape of a body, give an acceleration or deceleration or a change in direction depending on the direction of the force. • The resultant of forces acting in the same dimension will be their sum, provided a convention for directions is set. Therefore, the resultant of 2 forces acting in the same dimension, in the opposite direction will be the difference in their magnitude in the direction of the greatest. • If there is no resultant force acting on a body, it either remains at rest or continues at constant speed in a straight line RESISTIVE FORCES • Friction: the force between two surfaces which impedes motion and results in heating • Air resistance is a form of friction NEWTON’S LAWS OF MOTION • First law of motion: If no external for is acting on it, an object will, if stationary, remain stationary, and if moving, keep moving at a steady speed in the same straight line • Second law of motion: 𝑭 = 𝒎𝒂 • Third law of motion: if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B will exert an equal but opposite force on object A HOOKE’S LAW • Springs extend in proportion to load, as long as they are under their proportional limit. • Limit of proportionality: point at which load and extension are no longer proportional

CIRCULAR MOTION • An object at steady speed in circular orbit is always accelerating as its direction is changing, but it gets no closer to the center. The speed of the ball stays constant. • Centripetal force is the force acting towards the center of a circle. It is a force that is needed, not caused, by circular motion,  • For example, when you swing a ball on a string round in a circle, the tension of the string is the centripetal force. If the string is cut then the ball will travel in a straight line at a tangent to the circle at the point where the string was cut. • Centrifugal force is the force acting away from the center of a circle. This is what makes a slingshot go outwards as you spin it. The centrifugal force is the reaction to the centripetal force. It has the same magnitude but opposite direction to #>centripetal force.

 Simple Kinetic Molecular Model of Matter 
 
 
SOLID LIQUID GAS • Fixed shape and volume • Strong forces of attraction between particles- particles close to each other. • Fixed pattern (lattice)  • Atoms vibrate but can’t change position ∴ fixed volume and shape • Fixed volume but changes shape depending on its container • Weaker attractive forces than solids- medium distances between particels • No fixed pattern, liquids take shape of their container • Particles slide past each other. • No fixed shape or volume, gases fill up containers • Almost no intermolecular forces- large distances between particles • Particles far apart, and move quickly • Collide with each other and bounce in all directions • The more the kinetic energy in a gas, the faster it’s particles move and therefore the gas is at a higher temperature. • The pressure gases exert on a container is due to the particles colliding on the container walls. • The greater the kinetic energy in gasses the faster they move and the more often they collide on the container’s walls. • Therefore, the volume is constant, then increasing the temperature will increase the pressure. • Thus, if there is a change in momentum of the particles, the kinetic energy decreases, decreasing the collisions on the container walls and thus the pressure. BROWNIAN MOTION • Gas molecules move randomly. This is because of repeated random collisions with other gas molecules, which constantly change the direction they move in.  
 CIE IGCSE PHYSICS//0625

• Small molecules move much faster and have higher energy than larger molecules. They can effectively move large molecules due to repeated random bombardment- this can #>be seen by larger smoke particles moving. • Therefore, the random motion of particles in a suspension is evidence for the kinetic molecular model of matter.

 Evaporation • It is the escape of more energetic particles from the surface of a liquid. • If more energetic particles escape, the liquid contains few high energy particles and more low energy particles so the average temperature decreases. 
 
• In the above graph, the number of particles with higher kinetic energies has gone down.’ • Therefore a body in contact with an evaporating liquid with subsequently cool. • Evaporation can be accelerated by: o Increasing temperature: more particles have energy to escape o Increasing surface area: more molecules are close to the #>surface o Reduce humidity level in air (draught): if the air is less humid, fewer particles are condensing.

 Pressure Changes in Gases • Pressure is inversely proportional to the volume given a constant temperature. • If the volume increases and the temperature stays constant, the particles hit the surface less often, thus decreasing the pressure.  𝑷𝟏𝑽𝟏 = 𝑷𝟐𝑽𝟐

 Thermal properties and temperature • Solids, liquids and gasses expand when they are heated as atoms vibrate more and this causes them to become further apart, taking up a greater volume. • Due to differences in molecular structure of the different states of matter, expansion is greatest in gases, less so in liquids and lowest in solids • Applications and consequences of thermal expansion: o Overhead cables have to be slack so that on cold days, when they contract, they don’t snap or detach. o Gaps have to be left in bridge to allow for expansion  o Bimetal thermostat: when temperature gets too high, bimetal strip bends, to make contacts separate until temperature falls enough, then metal strip will become straight again and contacts touch, to maintain a steady temperature 
 
• Temperature can be measured by observing a physical property that changes with temperature. Examples include alcohol and mercury - used in thermometers. • Fixed points are definite temperatures at which something happens and are used to calibrate a thermometer. For example, melting and boiling point of water • Sensitivity: Change in length or volume per degree • Range: The values which can be measured using the thermometer • Linearity: Uniform changes in the physical property with a change in temperature over the measured temperature values. • Responsiveness: How long it takes for the thermometer to react to a change in temperature • Calibrating a thermometer: o Place thermometer in melting ice, this is 0 °C. o Place thermometer in boiling water, this is 100 °C.

• Liquid-in-glass thermometer: 
 
o As temperature rises or falls, the liquid (mercury or alcohol) expands or contracts.  o Amount of expansion can be matched to temperature on a scale. o To increase sensitivity: ▪ Thinner capillary ▪ Less dense liquid ▪ Bigger bulb o Depending on the melting and boiling point of the liquid being used, the range is defined. o The linearity depends on the liquid being used • Thermocouple thermometer: 
 
o The probe contains 2 different metals joined to form 2 junctions.  o The temperature difference causes a tiny voltage which makes a current flow.  o A greater temp. #>difference gives a greater current.  o Thermocouple thermometers are used for high temperatures which change rapidly and have a large range (-200C° to 1100°C)

 Thermal Capacity: • The rise in temperature of a body is an increase in the  internal energy of that body. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly proportional to the temperature. When of that gas particle. particles move faster due to greater kinetic energy, they collide more often, which is felt by heat • This relationship is shown by the thermal capacity of a  • Specific Heat capacity (c) is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a certain substance by 1o C.

 Melting and Boiling • Melting is when a solid turns into a liquid. • The temperature increases thus kinetic energy in solid increases and particles vibrate more rapidly. • When melting starts there is no increase in temperature of the substance because thermal energy supplied is being used to break bonds between particles of the solid thus making it into a liquid.  • The latent heat of fusion is the amount of energy needed to melt 1Kg of a substance • The melting point is the temp. at which a substance boils • Boiling is when a liquid turns into a gas • The temperature increases thus kinetic energy in liquid increases and particles vibrate more rapidly. • When boiling starts, there is no increase in temperature of the substance because the thermal energy supplied is being used to break bonds between particles of the liquid thus making it into a gas. • The latent heat of vaporization is the amount of energy needed to boil 1Kg of a substance • The boiling point is the temp. at which a substance melts

• The difference between boiling and evaporation is that: o Boiling occurs at a fixed temperature and throughout the liquid o Evaporation occurs at any temperature and only on the surface • Condensation is when a gas turns back into a liquid.  • When a gas is cooled, the particles lose energy. They move more and more slowly. When they bump into each other, they do not have enough energy to bounce away again so they stay close together, and a liquid forms.  • When a liquid cools, the particles slow down even more. Eventually they stop moving except for vibrations and a solid forms.

 Thermal Properties • Conduction is the flow of heat through matter from places of higher temperature to places of lower temperature without movement of the matter as a whole 
 CIE IGCSE PHYSICS//0625  
 
PAGE 9 OF 21 
• In non-metals - when heat is supplied to something, its atoms vibrate faster and pass on their vibrations to the adjacent atoms.  • In metals – conduction happens in the previous way and in a quicker way –electrons are free to move, they travel randomly in the metal and collide with atoms and pass on the vibrations Good conductors are used whenever heat is required to travel quickly through something • Bad conductors (insulators) are used to reduce the amount of heat lost to the surroundings • Convection is the flow of heat through a fluid from places of higher temperature in places of lower temperature by movement of the fluid itself. • As a fluid (liquid or gas) warms up, the particles which are warmer become less dense and rise.  • They then cool and fall back to the heat source, creating a cycle called convection current.  • As particles circulate they transfer energy to other particles. If a cooling object is above a fluid it will create a convection current as well. • Radiation is the flow of heat from one place to another by means of electromagnetic waves. It does not require a medium. • Thermal radiation is mainly infra-red waves, but very hot objects also give out light waves. Infra-red radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  MATT BLACK WHITE SILVER 
EMITTER Best  Worst REFLECTOR Worst  Best ABSORBER Best  Worst • An emitter sends out thermal radiation.  • A reflector reflects thermal radiation, therefore is a bad absorber.  • An emitter will cool down quickly, an absorber will heat up more quickly and a reflector will not heat up quickly. • The amount of radiation also depends on the surface temperature and surface area of a body. • Consequences of energy transfer include: o Metal spoon in a hot drink will warm up because it conducts heat o Convection currents create sea breezes. During the day the land is warmer and acts as heat source. During the night the sea acts as the heat source. o A black saucepan cools better than a white one, white houses stay cooler than dark ones.

  When water wave travels from deep to shallow; speed decreases, wavelength decreases and frequency remains constant When water waves travel from shallow to deep; speed increases wavelength increases and frequency remains constant • Reflection: o Waves bounce away from surface at same angle they strike it  o Angle of incidence = angle of reflection o The incident ray, normal and reflected ray all lie on the same plane. o Speed, wavelength and frequency are unchanged by reflection • Diffraction: • Waves bend round the sides of an obstacle, or spread out as they pass through a gap.  • Wider gaps produce less diffraction. • When the gap size is equal to the wavelength, maximum diffraction occurs

 Sound • Sound is a mechanical wave. • Sound waves come from a vibrating source e.g. loudspeaker • As the loudspeaker cone vibrates, it moves forwards and backwards, which squashes & stretches the air in front.  • As a result, a series of compressions (squashes) and rarefactions (stretches) travel out through the air, these are sound waves • Humans can hear frequencies between 20 and 20 000Hz. • Properties: o Sound waves are longitudinal: they have compressions and rarefactions and oscillate backwards and forwards. o Sound waves need a medium to travel through as it moves due to oscillating particles. • Ultrasound Waves: high frequency sound waves, medically used to look at structures and organs inside the human body, i.e. to form an image of a fetus in a pregnancy 
 
• Compression: High pressure section of a longitudinal wave • Rarefaction: Low pressure section of a longitudinal wave 
 
• The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch. • The higher the amplitude, the louder the sound

• If a sound is repeated 0.1 seconds or more after it is first heard, the brain senses it again. • Therefore , given the adequate distance, if sound reflects off a surface, and comes back, an echo is produced.

Simple phenomena of magnetism MAGNETS: • Magnets have a magnetic field around them • They 2 opposite poles (North and South) which exert forces on other magnets. Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. This is caused by the interaction of magnetic fields. o Therefore if magnets are facing each other with opposite poles, they will come together given a small space between them • They attract magnetic materials by inducing (permanent or temporary) magnetism in them. • Will exert little or no force on a non-magnetic material • The direction of an electric field at a point is the direction of the force on a positive charge at that point • Induced Magnetism: o Magnets attract materials by inducing magnetism in them; the material becomes a magnet as well.  o The side of the material facing the magnet will become the opposite pole as the magnet. FERROUS Magnetic materials NON-FERROUS Non-magnetic materials • IRON • NICKEL • COBALT • PLASTIC • WOOD • RUBBER 
• Methods of inducing magnetism: o A piece of steel becomes permanently magnetized when placed near a magnet, but its magnetism is usually weak. o It can be magnetized more strongly by stroking it with one end of a magnet o Most effective method: place it in a solenoid and pass a large, direct current (d.c.) through the coil. • Methods of demagnetisation: o If a magnet is hammered, its atomic magnets are thrown out of line and it becomes demagnetized. o Heating a magnet to a high temperature also demagnetize it. o Stroking with another magnet to destroy the alignment of poles o Place magnet with poles opposite to that which is induced by a d.c. current and insert into coil with d.c. current o Most efficient method: place magnet inside a solenoid connected to an alternating current (a.c.) supply. • Soft Iron vs. Steel  SOFT IRON STEEL • Gets magnetized faster but loses its magnetism as soon as inducing magnet is removed.  • High susceptibility but low retentivity • Use: core in the transformer • Slow to be magnetized but retains acquired magnetism for a long time.  • Low susceptibility but high retentivity. • Use: making magnets. • Permanent Magnet vs. Electromagnet PERMANENT MAGNET ELECTROMAGNET • Design: hard magnetic material • Use: for applications where magnetism is needed over long periods – fridge doors • Design: Uses a solenoid to create magnetic field • Use: For applications where magnetic field needs to be turned on & off - scrap metal moving

Electric Charge • There are 2 types of charges: positive and negative. • Unlike charges attract and like charges repel. • The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C). • The presence of an electrostatic charge can be detected using a leaf electroscope. o If a charged object is placed near the cap, charges are induced.  o The metal cap gets one type of charge (positive or negative) and the metal stem and gold leaf get the other type of charge so they repel each other. 
 
• Electric field: region in which electric charge experiences a force. • The direction of an electric field at a point is the direction of the force on a positive charge at that point • Conductors: materials that let electrons pass through them. Metals are the best electrical conductors as they have free electrons. E.g. copper • Insulators: materials that hardly conduct at all. Their electrons are tightly held to atoms and hardly move, but they can be transferred by rubbing. E.g. Rubber • Simple Field Patterns: 
 
   
Parallel plates 
Point charge 
+ve and -ve +ve and +ve 
• Induced charges: o Charging a body involves the addition or removal of electrons. o A charge that “appears” on an uncharged object because of a charged object nearby  o For example if a positively charged rod is brought near a small piece of aluminum foil, electrons in foil are pulled towards rod, which leaves the bottom of the foil with a net positive charge.  o The attraction is stronger than repulsion because the attracting charges are closer than the repelling ones.

Current • Current: a flow of charge, the SI unit is the Ampere (A). • An ammeter measures the current in a circuit and is connected in series • Current is a rate of flow of charge. • In metals, current is caused by a flow of electrons 
𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 (𝐴) =
𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 (𝐶) 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 (𝑠)

Electromotive Force (EMF) • The energy supplied by the source in driving a unit charge around a circuit. • The maximum voltage a cell can produce is called the electromotive force (EMF), measured in volts.  • When a current is being supplied, the voltage is lower because of the energy wastage inside the cell.  • A cell produces its maximum PD when not in a circuit and not supplying current.

Potential Difference (P.D) • Potential difference, or PD for short, is also known as voltage. • Voltage is the amount of energy the cell gives the electrons it pushes out. Voltage is measured in volts (V) and is measured by a voltmeter (connected in parallel). If a cell has 1 Volt, it delivers 1 Joule of energy to each coulomb of charge (J/C).

Factors affecting resistance: • Length o Ω ∝ 𝐿 o The electrons have to travel a longer length and thus encounter more resistance. • Cross-sectional area o Ω ∝ 1 𝐴
 o More electrons can flow per unit time, increasing the current and therefore decreasing the resistance. • Material o Better conductor = less resistance • Current Voltage Character of an Ohmic Resistor and a Filament Lamp: 
 
o Ohm’s law states that voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current through it. This is only true if the temperature of the resistor or lamp remains constant

Series and Parallel Circuits • The current at any point in a series circuit is the same • The current splits at each branch in a parallel circuit so the total current is always greater than the current in one branch • Combining resistors o In Series: 𝑹𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 = 𝑹𝟏 + 𝑹𝟐 o In Parallel: 𝑹𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 = 𝟏 𝟏 𝑹𝟏⁄ +𝟏 𝑹𝟐 ⁄
 o The combined resistance of 2 resistors in parallel is less than that of either resistor by itself and the current in the two resistors in greater in the source than in the individual resistors and is equal to the sum of the currents in all the resistors connected in parallel. • Advantages of putting lamps in parallel are: o If one lamp breaks, the other still works o Each lamp gets maximum PD • In series: PD across the supply = PD across all the components combined • In parallel: Current across the source = sum of currents in the separate branches

 Action and Use of Circuit Components: • A potential divider divides the voltage into smaller parts.  
 
• To find the voltage (at VOUT) we use the following formula: 
𝑽𝑶𝑼𝑻 = 𝑽𝑰𝑵 × (
𝑹𝟐 𝑹𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍
) • A variable potential divider (potentiometer) is the same as the one above but using a variable resistor; it acts like a potential divider, but you can change output voltage. • Input Transducers: o Thermistor: input sensor and a transducer. It is a temperaturedependent resistor. At higher temperature there is less resistance. o Light dependent resistor (LDR): input sensor and a transducer. When light intensity increases, resistance decreases. • Relays: o A switch operated by an electromagnet

• Diodes: o A device that has an extremely high resistance in one direction and a low resistance in the other, therefore it effectively only allows current to flow in one direction o Forward bias is when the diode is pointing in the direction of the conventional current and reverse bias is the opposite o It can be used in a rectifier; turns AC current into DC current.

 Digital Electronics • Analogue uses a whole range of continuous variations to transmit a signal that include variations of high and low states. • Digital signals use only 2 states, on and off.  • Logic gates are processors that are circuits containing transistors and other components. Their function is shown by the truth table below (3 columns from the right)

 Dangers of Electricity: • Hazards: o Damaged insulation: contact with the wire (live wire especially) due to gap in the insulation causes electric shock which can cause serious injury or shock. o Overheating of cables: when long extension leads are coiled up, they may overheat. The current warms the wire, but the heat has less area to escape from a tight bundle. This might cause a fire. o Damp conditions: water can conduct a current, so if electrical equipment is wet someone might get electrocuted FUSE 
 CIRCUIT BREAKER 
 
A fuse protects a circuit. Thin piece of wire which overheats and melts if current is too high. It is placed on the live wire before the switch. This prevents overheating and catching fire. A fuse will have a specific current value (e.g. 13 Amps.) so when choosing a suitable fuse you must use the one above minimum value but less than maxiumum value 
An automatic switch which if current rises over a specified value, the electromagnet pulls the contacts apart, breaking the circuit. The reset button is to rest everything. It works like a fuse but is better because it can be reset. 
 
• Benefits of Earthing a Metal Case: o Many electrical appliances, have metal cases, the earth wire creates a safe route for current to flow through if the  live wire touches the casing o Earth terminal connected to metal casing, so in such a case, the current goes through earth wire instead of causing an electric shock.  o A strong current surges through earth wire because it has very low resistance o This breaks the fuse and disconnects the appliance

 Electromagnetic Effects • Electromagnetic Induction: If a wire is passed across a magnetic field/changing magnetic field, a small EMF is induced and can be detected by a galvanometer. • The direction of an induced EMF opposes the change causing it. • The induced EMF can be increased by: o moving the wire faster o using a stronger magnet o Increasing length of wire in magnetic field, e.g. looping the wire through the field several times. • The current and EMF direction can be reversed by: o moving the wire in the opposite direction o turning the magnet round so that the field direction is reversed • Fleming’s right-hand rule gives the current direction: 
 
 
 
Bar magnet pushed into coil 
 
• The induced EMF (and current) can be increased by: o moving the magnet faster o using a stronger magnet o increasing the number of turns in the coil • If the magnet is pulled away, the direction of the induced EMF (and current) is reversed • Using South pole instead of North pole reverses direction of induced EMF (and current) • If the magnet is held still, there is no EMF • An induced current always flows in a direction such that it opposes the change which produced it.  
• When a magnet is moved towards a coil the pole of the coil and magnet next to each other are the same.  • When the magnet is moved away the poles are opposite (opposite poles attract). • The pole-type (north or south) is controlled by the direction in which the current is induced. • The direction of the current is given by the right-hand grip rule: 
 
• The fingers point in the conventional current direction and the thumb gives the North Pole.

 Applications • In a direct current (d.c) the electrons flow in a singular direction. • In an alternating current (a.c) the direction of flow is reversed in regular time periods. • A.C Generator: o The coil is made of insulated copper wire and is rotated by turning the shaft; the slip rings are fixed to the coil and rotate with it.  o The brushes are 2 contacts which rub against the slip rings and keep the coil connected to the outside part of the circuit, usually made of carbon.  o When the coil is rotated, it cuts magnetic field lines, so an EMF is generated, which makes a current flow.  o Each side of the coil travels upwards then downwards then upwards etc. so the current flows backwards then forwards then backwards etc. so it is an alternating current.

PAGE 19 OF 21 
• The current is maximum when the coil is horizontal since field lines are being cut at the fastest rate and 0 when the coil is vertical, since it is cutting NO field lines.  • The EMF can be increased by: o increasing the number of turns on the coil o increasing the area of the coil o using a stronger magnet o rotating the coil faster

 Transformers • AC currents can be increased or decreased by using a transformer.  • Consists of a primary coil, a secondary coil and an iron core.  • The iron core gets magnetized by the incoming current and this magnetism then creates a current in the leaving wire.  • The power is the same on both sides (assume= 100% efficiency).  • You can figure out number of coils and the voltage with: 𝑶𝒖𝒕𝒑𝒖𝒕 𝒗𝒐𝒍𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝑰𝒏𝒑𝒖𝒕 𝒗𝒐𝒍𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 = 𝑻𝒖𝒓𝒏𝒔 𝒐𝒏 𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒑𝒖𝒕 𝒄𝒐𝒊𝒍 𝑻𝒖𝒓𝒏𝒔 𝒐𝒏 𝒊𝒏𝒑𝒖𝒕 𝒄𝒐𝒊𝒍

• Increasing the strength of the field  • Increasing the current increases the strength of the field • Increasing the number of turns of a coil increases the strength increases the strength of the field. • Reversing the current direction reverses the magnetic field direction (right-hand rule). • The direction of a magnetic field line at a point is the direction of the force on the N pole of a magnet at that point • Magnetic effect of current is used in a relay and a circuit breaker.

 Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor • If a current carrying conductor is in a magnetic field, it warps the field lines.  • The field lines from the magnet want to straighten out naturally.  • This causes a catapult like action on the wire creating a force 
 
• If you reverse current, you will reverse direction of force • If you reverse direction of field, you will reverse direction of force.

 D.C. Motor 
 
• When a current-carrying coil is in a magnetic field, it experiences a turning effect. • A DC motor runs on a direct current.  • The coil is made of insulated copper wire and is free to rotate between the poles of the magnet.  • The commutator (split-ring) is fixed to the coil and rotates with it.  • When the coil overshoots the vertical, the commutator changes direction of the current through it, so the forces change direction and keep the coil turning.  • The brushes are two contacts which rub against the commutator and keep the coil connected to battery, usually made of carbon • The max. turning effect is when the coil is horizontal.  • There is no force when the coil is vertical but it always overshoots this position

Radioactive Decay • Radioactive decay: A radioisotope (unstable arrangement of neutrons and protons) is altered to make a more stable arrangement.  • The parent nucleus becomes a daughter nucleus and a particle (decay products). • The nucleus changes when undergoing alpha or beta decay Alpha decay: • An element with a proton number 2 lower and nucleon number 4 lower, and an alpha particle is made (2p + 2n) e.g. Radium-226 nucleus → Radon-222 + helium-4 nucleus Ra88 226 → Rn 86 222 + He 2 4 Beta decay: • A neutron changes into a proton, an electron and an antineutrino so an element with the same nucleon number but with a proton number 1 higher e.g. e.g. iodine-131 → xenon-131 + antineutrino + beta particle 𝐼53 131 → 𝑋𝑒 54 131 + β −1 0 + v 0 0
